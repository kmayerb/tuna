Description: Tuna makes it easy to repeat regularized regressions 
    in the popular package [glmnet] (https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v033i01) 
    and vizualize the results.  Lasso, ridge, and glmnet regressions typically use cross validation 
    to determine a suitable value of the regularization hyperparameter
    that minimizes the cross-validated estimate of out of sample error. 
    The number of non-zero coefficients can vary depending on initialization
    of coordinate gradient decent used to estimate arguments that maximize the penalized 
    likelihood function. Therefore, if regularized regression is being used 
    for feature selection it is worth repeating cross validation and gradient decent.
